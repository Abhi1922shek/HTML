    <h1>DevOps</h1>
    <hr>
    <p><b>DevOps</b> is a methodology in the <mark>software development</mark> and <mark>IT operations</mark>. Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle.<sup>[1]</sup></sup></p>

    <h2>History</h2><hr>
    <p>Proposals to combine software development methodologies with deployment and operations concepts began to appear in the late 80s and early 90s. <sub>[2]</sub></p>
    <p>Around 2007 and 2008, concerns were raised by those within the software development and IT communities that the separation between the two industries, where one wrote and created software entirely separate from those that deploy and support the software was creating a fatal level of dysfunction within the industry.[3]
    <p>In 2009, the first conference named DevOps Days was held in Ghent, Belgium. The conference was founded by Belgian consultant, <del>project manager</del><ins></ins> <ins>agile practitioner Patrick Debois</ins>.<sup>[4][5]</sup> The conference has now spread to other countries.<sup>[6]</sup></p>
